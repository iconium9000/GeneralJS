/*
  Write a timer program that accepts a number of seconds to count down
  from as an argument.

  The program counts down from that number until 0, decerementing every
  second.

  It displays the time remaining.

  It reprograms the terminal driver to support pausing the timer.  It does
  this by reprogramming terminal settings VSTART and VSTOP to S and Q.
  S - starts the timer / Q - pauses the timer.

  When the user types Q or S, that is not shown on the screen, so the
  program should disable echoing while it's running as well.
  ---
  The program supports the following commands :
  p - pauses the timer
  u - unpauses the timer
